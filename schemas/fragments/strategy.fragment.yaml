  Strategic modeling elements that connect business processes to
  organizational capabilities and value delivery.
  
  This fragment defines:
  - Value Streams: End-to-end value creation flows
  - Capabilities: What the organization can do
  - Products: Tangible offerings to customers
  - Services: Intangible offerings to customers
  - Portfolios: Groupings of products/services/capabilities

  # VALUE STREAM
  # ==========================================================================

  ValueStream:
    description: |
      An end-to-end sequence of activities that delivers value to a customer.
      
      Value streams differ from processes:
      - VALUE STREAMS are customer-focused, end-to-end flows
      - PROCESSES are operational, may be internal
      
      A value stream often spans multiple processes and may cross
      organizational boundaries.
      
      EXAMPLES:
      - "Order to Cash" - from order to payment collection
      - "Hire to Retire" - employee lifecycle
      - "Concept to Market" - product development
      - "Issue to Resolution" - customer support
      
      USAGE:
      Value streams provide strategic context for process optimization.
      They help answer "why does this process exist?" and "who cares?"

  # CAPABILITY
  # ==========================================================================

  Capability:
    description: |
      An organizational capability - what the organization can do.
      
      Capabilities abstract away HOW things are done (processes) to focus
      on WHAT the organization can do. This enables:
      - Strategic planning independent of current implementation
      - Gap analysis and capability development planning
      - Sourcing decisions (build vs. buy vs. outsource)
      
      CAPABILITY vs PROCESS:
      - Capability: "We can fulfill orders" (what)
      - Process: "Order fulfillment process" (how)
      
      Capabilities are typically organized in a hierarchy (capability map).
      
      MATURITY LEVELS:
      1 - Initial: Ad-hoc, inconsistent
      2 - Repeatable: Basic processes in place
      3 - Defined: Standardized, documented
      4 - Managed: Measured, controlled
      5 - Optimizing: Continuously improving
