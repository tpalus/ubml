  Actor documents define the people, roles, teams, and systems that

  WHAT IS AN ACTOR?
  An actor is any entity that performs work in a process:
  - Roles (Job titles, functional roles)
  - Teams (Departments, groups)
  - Systems (IT systems, automated services)
  - External parties (Customers, vendors)
  
  ACTOR COMPONENTS:
  - Actors: The participants themselves with skills and availability
  - Skills: Competencies and capabilities actors possess
  - ResourcePools: Groups of actors for capacity planning
  - Equipment: Physical resources used by actors
  
  FILE NAMING: *.actors.ubml.yaml
  Examples:
    - sales-team.actors.ubml.yaml
    - operations-department.actors.ubml.yaml
    - external-parties.actors.ubml.yaml
  
  GETTING STARTED:
  1. Define actors with their types (role, team, system, external)
  2. Add skills they possess
  3. Define availability and capacity
  4. Optionally add personas and pain points
