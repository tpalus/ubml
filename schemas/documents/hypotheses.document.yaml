  Hypothesis documents define hypothesis trees for structured problem framing.
  
  WHAT IS A HYPOTHESIS TREE?
  A hypothesis tree decomposes a main hypothesis into sub-hypotheses
  that can be independently validated. It uses the SCQH framework:
  - Situation: Current state/context
  - Complication: What changed/problem
  - Question: Key question arising
  - Hypothesis: Proposed answer
  
  WHY USE HYPOTHESIS TREES?
  Hypothesis trees enable:
  - Structured problem decomposition
  - Evidence-based decision making
  - Clear communication of reasoning
  - Progress tracking on analysis
  
  FILE NAMING: *.hypotheses.ubml.yaml
  Examples:
    - process-improvement.hypotheses.ubml.yaml
    - market-entry.hypotheses.ubml.yaml
    - cost-reduction.hypotheses.ubml.yaml
  
  GETTING STARTED:
  1. Define the SCQH context
  2. Create the root hypothesis
  3. Decompose into sub-hypotheses
  4. Track validation status as you gather evidence

      Hypothesis tree definitions, keyed by tree ID.
      
      Hypothesis tree IDs follow the HT### pattern (e.g., HT001, HT002).
      
      Example:
        hypothesisTrees:
          HT001:
            name: "Process Optimization Analysis"
            scqh:
              situation: "Current process takes 5 days"
              complication: "Customers expect 2 days"
              question: "How can we reduce to 2 days?"
              hypothesis: "Streamline approvals and automate"
            root:
              id: H001
              text: "We can achieve 2-day processing"
              children:
                - id: H002
                  text: "Approvals can be streamlined"
